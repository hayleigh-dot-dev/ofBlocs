Blocs
Andrew Thompson

Blocs is a playful digital music interface intended for single users or small groups. Placing blocks in an 8x8 grid, users interact with a number of digital agents. Agents move independently but react to the world users create for them, bumping into blocks and making notes. Thus a dialogue between user and agent begins as the user assumes the role of pseudo-conductor, attempting to guide the agents and crafting a piece of music while also responding to the agents’ movements. The interface explores the dichotomy that exists between a sound toy and a 'legitimate' music instrument; particularly playing with how much control can be taken away from users before they lose their creative agency.

The presentation of the instrument is inspired by both children’s block toys and traditional acoustic instruments. This design encourages interaction and play while looking familiar: the deeper mechanics of the interface as well as knowledge of musical theory is abstracted by the interface to encourage participation while still being a creatively engaging process. 

Under the hood, Blocs employs a number of creative coding frameworks and hardware platforms: specifically Arduino as the control surface, Raspberry Pi as the main processor, openFrameworks as the core program, and Pure Data to handle the audio synthesis.
